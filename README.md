# johnson-graph-qwalk
Circuital implementation of a Quantum Random Walk on a Johnson graph using qiskit.

This is the code relative to the Master thesis "Design of a Quantum Circuit for Quantum Random Walks on Johnson graphs, Solving the ISD problem for code-based Post-quantum Cryptosystems" by Matteo Lodi and Giacomo Lancellotti.
