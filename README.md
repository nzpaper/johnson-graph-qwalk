# Quantum Random Walk on a Johnson graph
Circuital implementation of a Quantum Random Walk on a Johnson graph J(n,k) using qiskit. Parts of the code are still relative to the J(4,2) example, it's still a WIP.

The oracles used for the search problem are relative to the collision-finding subprocedure of the Finiasz-Sendrier ISD attack.

This is work is based on the Master thesis titled "Design of a Quantum Circuit for Quantum Random Walks on Johnson graphs, Solving the ISD problem for code-based Post-quantum Cryptosystems" by Giacomo Lancellotti (https://github.com/GiacomoLancellotti) and Matteo Lodi (https://github.com/nzpaper), Politecnico di Milano.
